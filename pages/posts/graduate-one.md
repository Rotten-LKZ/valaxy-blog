有太多太多的话想说，有关于毕业……

终于轮到我毕业了。我不太明白在不同国家毕业意味着什么，但是我知道，在我的国家，至少对于我来说，它是一个快乐但是伤感、轻松但是充满遗憾的时刻。

我们开心放松是因为我们迎来一个没有同伴和学习压力的长假期。我们伤感、遗憾因为我们必须得跟对方道别，不管是不是朋友或是仇人。

在期末考试过后，我们会有一场毕业典礼。这场毕业典礼通常会是一顿聚餐，在这顿餐过后，我们各奔东西、形同陌路。

几年过去，我们可能会有一个聚会。我们聚在一起侃大山。当年的好朋友们可能在叙旧情。但是，我们不再拥有跟以前一样的感觉了。

There are a lot of words I wanna say, about graduation.

It's finally my turn to graduate. I don't very understand what graduation means in different countries, but I know, in my country, or just for me, it is a happy but sentimental, relaxed but regrettable moment.

We are happy and relaxed because we have a long-term holiday without the pressure from study and peers. We are sentimental and regrettable because we need to say goodbye to each other, whether we are good friends or enemies.

We always have a graduation ceremony after final exam. This ceremony is usually a meal, and after this meal, we go our separate ways, like strangers.

Serveral years later, we might have a party. We gather together, chat aimlessly and good friends at that time are talking about old times. However, we don't have the same feelings as before.

But, graduation, or parting, is something we can't avoid, unless we don't meet each other at first...
