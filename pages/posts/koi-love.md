From my point of view, I think the most beautiful thing in the world, it may be not a real thing, but an emotion.

Imagine a story: the main character in the story is a normal people. He might not get a great grade or have high level. Or he doesn't look very handsome, his behavior isn't elegant. He with these, likes a girl lurkingly, which is his deskmate.

And then, in order not to disturb her, he doesn't tell his feelings emotionally. After Gaokao(College Entrance Exam, an very important test in China for students about 18 years old), he takes his bravery and tells his feelings to that girl. I don't sure if he can succeed... But one thing I can certain is that this is a leave-taking to youth, with an end of the emotion, or a continuing and development of the emotion.

In any case, I know this relationship is beautiful and what I yearn for. But I don't think everyone can experience it.

Let me tell you another story: the protagonist of the story developed a timid and fearful mentality when he was a child, and I can't describe it clearly and exactly, maybe it can be called: **glass heart**. He is such a person, especially when he was a child, he might have been defrauded of money because of his lack of awareness. His heart seems to be more and more closed, maybe his appearance is sunny, and his heart may be caught in self-contradiction.

In junior high school, the boy falls in love with a girl for some reason. It is not the same table, nor is it primary school classmates, it may just be love at first sight. It is said that many people like this girl, and this girl has many choices. But the boy doesn't have too much communication with the woman, it is better to say that there was no communication, and they just know a little about each other, and the boy didn't know much about her. Once, the boy tries his best to tell his feelings, and she replies intermittently. Finally, the cruel reality hits the boy's heart. This is the inevitable ending, no need to ask more.

After that, the boy may still think about the girl, and he may also see the process of the first boy liking the girl. What will the second boy with the glass heart think when he sees the bravery of the first boy? Self-contradictory? escape? numbness? confused? I don't know the answer... However, I know that, the second boy may be me...

对我来说，我认为世界上最美的东西，可能不是某个现实存在的物质，而是一段情感。

想象这样一个故事：故事里的主人公是一个平凡的大众。他学习上可能并不能取得优异成绩、平列前茅。或者说长相有多么帅气，行为举止有多么得优雅。这样的人暗恋上了一位女孩子，是他的同桌。

于是乎，他为了不打扰她，并没有冲动表白。高考之后，他拿出自己十二分勇气，向那位女孩子说出自己的心声。我并不知道他是否成功……但我唯一可以确定的事情是，这是对青春的告别，以一段感情的结束，亦或者感情的延续和发展。

不管怎么说，我知道这段感情是美好的，也是我所向往的。但我并不认为所有人都可以体验得到。

我再讲一个故事：故事的主人公小时候就养成一种比较胆小怕事的心理，也不能这么说，可能可以叫做：**玻璃心**。他就是一个这样的人，尤其或许小时候防范意识不强被人骗钱了。他的内心越来越似乎封闭起来，可能外表是阳光的，内心可能陷入了自我矛盾。

上了初中，这位男孩子不知为何喜欢上了一个女孩子。并不是同桌，也不是小学同学，可能只是一见钟情。据说很多人喜欢这位女孩子，这位女孩子也有许多选择。可这个男孩并没有与女方有过多的交流，倒不如说，没有交流，也只是互相知道有这个人，男孩子也没有了解过对方。一次，男孩子鼓足了干劲想要表白，断断续续的回复，最后，残酷的现实击中了男孩子的心里。这是必然的结局，不必多问。

这之后，男孩也许还想着这名女孩，也可能会看到第一位男孩喜欢女孩子的历程。玻璃心的第二位男孩看到第一位男孩的勇敢会有什么样的想法吗？自我矛盾？逃避？麻木？迷茫？我不知道答案…… 但是，我知道，第二个男生可能就是我……
